openSUSE tcl-trf RPM spec  

[Trf](http://tcltrf.sourceforge.net/) is an extension library to the script language tcl.
It provides transformer procedures which change the flow of bytes
through a channel in arbitrary ways. The underlying functionality in
the core is that of stacked channels which allows code outside of the
core to intercept all actions (read/write) on a channel.

Among the applications of the above provided here are compression, 
charset recording, error correction, and hash generation.
